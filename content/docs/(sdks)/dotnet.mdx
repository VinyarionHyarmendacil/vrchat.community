A .NET client to interact with the unofficial VRChat API. Supports all REST calls specified in https://github.com/vrchatapi/specification.

<GithubInfo className="not-prose" owner="vrchatapi" repo="vrchatapi-csharp" />

<Callout type="info" title="Important">
Please review the [API guidelines and disclaimers](https://vrchat.community/) on the homepage before using this SDK. The VRChat API is unofficial and usage guidelines apply.

## Installation

Install with NuGet:

```package-install
dotnet add package VRChat.API
```

### Dependency Injection Package

If you're working with Dependency Injection like ASP.NET Core or Discord.Net, make sure to also install the DI package:

```package-install
dotnet add package VRChat.API.Extensions.Hosting
```

## Getting Started

The following example code authenticates you with the API and logs you in.

```cs
using System;
using VRChat.API.Client;

// WithApplication or WithUserAgent is required or VRChat will reject your requests
IVRChat vrchat = new VRChatClientBuilder() // More options available
    .WithUsername("username")
    .WithPassword("password")
    .WithTwoFactorSecret("twoFactorSecret") 
    .WithApplication(name: "Example", version: "1.0.0", contact: "CONTACT_EMAIL")
    .Build();

// Recommended to set up 2FA on your account for seamless login
// There is also IVRChat.TryLoginAsync()
var user = await vrchat.LoginAsync();
Console.WriteLine($"Logged in as {user.DisplayName}!");
```

The builder is quite flexible and will let you customize as you see fit.

It's recommended to set up 2FA on your account with a TOTP secret for seamless automated login.

### Authentication with Cookies

You can set authentication cookies yourself by attaching them during the client building process:

```cs
IVRChat vrchat = new VRChatClientBuilder()
    .WithUsername("username")
    .WithPassword("password")
    .WithTwoFactorSecret("twoFactorSecret") 
    .WithApplication(name: "Example", version: "1.0.0", contact: "CONTACT_EMAIL")
    .WithAuthCookie("auth cookie", "twoFactorAuth cookie")
    .Build();
```

## Working with Cookies

### Getting Cookies

You can fetch the cookies that the API client has using the `IVRChat.GetCookies()` method:

```cs
var cookies = vrchat.GetCookies(); // List<Cookie>
```

This is useful for storing authentication state and reusing it later without re-authenticating.

## Dependency Injection

Working with Microsoft DI is easy. After installing the DI package `VRChat.API.Extensions.Hosting`, you can easily attach it to your .NET DI Host, including ASP.NET Core, .NET Aspire, and Discord.Net.

### Fluent Builder

```cs
// Assuming you have a IServiceCollection services defined somewhere
services.AddVRChat(builder => builder.WithUsername("username"));
```

### Named Clients

```cs
services.AddVRChat("WorldsClient", builder => builder.WithUsername("username"));
```

### Loading from IConfiguration

Supports environment variables, configuration files, and user secrets:

```cs
services.AddVRChat(builder.Configuration.GetSection("VRChat"));
```

To see the available options for loading from an `IConfiguration`, see the [VRChatOptions.cs](https://github.com/vrchatapi/vrchatapi-csharp/blob/main/VRChat.API.Extensions.Hosting/VRChatOptions.cs) file.

### Working with Named Clients

Instead of requesting an `IVRChat` from services, you will request an `IVRChatClientFactory`. Unnamed clients will have a default name of `vrc_default` and registering multiple will overwrite the previous one.

```cs
public class MyController : Controller
{
    [HttpGet("/worlds/active")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> GetActiveWorldsAsync([FromServices] IVRChatClientFactory factory)
    {
        var vrchat = factory.CreateClient("WorldsClient");
        var worlds = await vrchat.Worlds.GetActiveWorldsAsync();
        return Ok(worlds);
    }
}
```

## Example Projects

The SDK includes several example projects to help you get started:

- **Console app (login)**: See [VRChat.API.Examples.Console](https://github.com/vrchatapi/vrchatapi-csharp/tree/main/examples/VRChat.API.Examples.Console/)
- **ASP.NET Core (dependency injection)**: See [VRChat.API.Examples.AspNetCore](https://github.com/vrchatapi/vrchatapi-csharp/tree/main/examples/VRChat.API.Examples.AspNetCore/)
