          API config contains configuration that the clients needs to work
          properly.


          Currently the most important value here is `clientApiKey` which is
          used for all other API endpoints.

          IPS (Info Push System) is a system for VRChat to push out dynamic
          information to the client. This is primarily used by the Quick-Menu
          info banners, but can also be used to e.g. alert you to update your
          game to the latest version.


          `include` is used to query what Information Pushes should be included
          in the response. If include is missing or empty, then no notices will
          normally be returned. This is an "any of" search.


          `require` is used to limit what Information Pushes should be included
          in the response. This is usually used in combination with `include`,
          and is an "all of" search.

          ~~Gets the overall health status, the server name, and the current
          build version tag of the API.~~


          **DEPRECATED:** VRChat has suddenly restricted this endpoint for
          unknown reasons, and now always return 401 Unauthorized.

          Returns the current number of online users.


          **NOTE:** The response type is not a JSON object, but a simple JSON
          integer.
        heading: current-online-users
      - content: >-
          Returns the current time of the API server.


          **NOTE:** The response type is not a JSON object, but a simple JSON
          string.
