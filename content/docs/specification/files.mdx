      - content: Returns a list of files
        heading: list-files
      - content: Creates a new File object
        heading: create-file
      - content: >-
          Shows general information about the "File" object. Each File can have
          several "Version"'s, and each Version can have multiple real files or
          "Data" blobs.
        heading: show-file
      - content: >-
          Creates a new FileVersion. Once a Version has been created, proceed to
          the `/file/{fileId}/{versionId}/file/start` endpoint to start a file
          upload.
        heading: create-file-version
      - content: Deletes a File object.
        heading: delete-file
      - content: >-
          Downloads the file with the provided version number.


          **Version Note:** Version 0 is always when the file was created. The
          real data is usually always located in version 1 and up.


          **Extension Note:** Files are not guaranteed to have a file
          extensions. UnityPackage files tends to have it, images through this
          endpoint do not. You are responsible for appending file extension from
          the `extension` field when neccesary.
        heading: download-file-version
      - content: >-
          Delete a specific version of a file. You can only delete the latest
          version.
        heading: delete-file-version
      - content: >-
          Finish an upload of a FileData. This will mark it as "complete". After
          uploading the `file` for Avatars and Worlds you then have to upload a
          `signature` file.
        heading: finish-filedata-upload
      - content: >-
          Starts an upload of a specific FilePart. This endpoint will return an
          AWS URL which you can PUT data to. You need to call this and receive a
          new AWS API URL for each `partNumber`. Please see AWS's REST
          documentation on "PUT Object to S3" on how to upload. Once all parts
          has been uploaded, proceed to `/finish` endpoint.


          **Note:** `nextPartNumber` seems like it is always ignored. Despite it
          returning 0, first partNumber is always 1.
        heading: start-filedata-upload
      - content: >-
          Retrieves the upload status for file upload. Can currently only be
          accessed when `status` is `waiting`. Trying to access it on a file
          version already uploaded currently times out.
        heading: check-filedata-upload-status
      - content: Get the performance analysis for the uploaded assets of an avatar
        heading: get-file-version-analysis
      - content: >-
          Get the security performance analysis for the uploaded assets of an
          avatar
        heading: get-file-version-analysis-security
      - content: >-
          Get the standard performance analysis for the uploaded assets of an
          avatar
        heading: get-file-version-analysis-standard
      - content: Upload an image, which can be an icon, gallery image, sticker or emoji
        heading: upload-gallery-image-icon-emoji-or-sticker
      - content: Upload an icon
        heading: upload-icon
      - content: Upload a gallery image
