          Checks if a user by a given `username`, `displayName` or `email`
          exist. This is used during registration to check if a username has
          already been taken, during change of displayName to check if a
          displayName is available, and during change of email to check if the
          email is already used. In the later two cases the `excludeUserId` is
          used to exclude oneself, otherwise the result would always be true.


          It is **REQUIRED** to include **AT LEAST** `username`, `displayName`
          **or** `email` query parameter. Although they can be combined - in
          addition with `excludeUserId` (generally to exclude yourself) - to
          further fine-tune the search.

          This endpoint does the following two operations:
            1) Checks if you are already logged in by looking for a valid `auth` cookie. If you are have a valid auth cookie then no additional auth-related actions are taken. If you are **not** logged in then it will log you in with the `Authorization` header and set the `auth` cookie. The `auth` cookie will only be sent once.
            2) If logged in, this function will also return the CurrentUser object containing detailed information about the currently logged in user.

          The auth string after `Authorization: Basic {string}` is a
          base64-encoded string of the username and password, both individually
          url-encoded, and then joined with a colon.
            
          > base64(urlencode(username):urlencode(password))


          **WARNING: Session Limit:** Each authentication with login credentials
          counts as a separate session, out of which you have a limited amount.
          Make sure to save and reuse the `auth` cookie if you are often
          restarting the program. The provided API libraries automatically save
          cookies during runtime, but does not persist during restart. While it
          can be fine to use username/password during development, expect in
          production to very fast run into the rate-limit and be temporarily
          blocked from making new sessions until older ones expire. The exact
          number of simultaneous sessions is unknown/undisclosed.

          Deletes the account with given ID. Normal users only have permission
          to delete their own account. Account deletion is 14 days from this
          request, and will be cancelled if you do an authenticated request with
          the account afterwards.


          **VRC+ NOTE:** Despite the 14-days cooldown, any VRC+ subscription
          will be cancelled **immediately**.


          **METHOD NOTE:** Despite this being a Delete action, the method type
          required is PUT.
        heading: delete-user
      - content: >-
          ~~Register a new user account.~~


          **DEPRECATED:** Automated creation of accounts has no legitimate
          public third-party use case, and would be in violation of ToS ยง13.2:

          *By using the Platform, you agree not to: i. [...] use the Platform in
          a manner inconsistent with individual human usage*

          This endpoint is documented in the interest of completeness
