          Deletes an outgoing pending friend request to another user. To delete
          an incoming friend request, use the `deleteNotification` endpoint
          instead.
        heading: delete-friend-request
      - content: >-
          Retrieve if the user is currently a friend with a given user, if they
          have an outgoing friend request, and if they have an incoming friend
          request. The proper way to receive and accept friend request is by
          checking if the user has an incoming `Notification` of type
          `friendRequest`, and then accepting that notification.
