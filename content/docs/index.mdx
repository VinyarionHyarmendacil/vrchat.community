**VRChat.community** is a comprehensive, community-driven project that provides documentation, tools, and resources for developers working with the VRChat API. This project fills the gap left by VRChat's lack of official API documentation and support.

<Callout type="warn">
  **VRChat's API is not officially supported or documented by VRChat.** This documentation project is maintained on a best-effort basis by the community and attempts to smooth over API breakage by quickly updating when endpoints change.
  
  Use responsibly and be aware that endpoints may still break without notice. Abuse of the API may result in account termination. For their official stance, refer to [VRChat's Creator Guidelines](https://hello.vrchat.com/creator-guidelines).
