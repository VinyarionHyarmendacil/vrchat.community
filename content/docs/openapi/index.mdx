title: "OpenAPI Specification"
---

The OpenAPI Specification defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.

The produced outcome is something of surprising quality and allows us to work quickly and efficiently in keeping the documentation up to date. Adding new endpoints or correcting something that's outdated can be fixed and downstreamed into all the SDKs in matter of minutes. This helps to ensure that even during periods of low contribution it is still possible to keep the documentation up to speed with the public API.
