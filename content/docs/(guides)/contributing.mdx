## Repositories

<Callout type="info">
The VRChat API project is spread across multiple repositories, each serving a different purpose.
</Callout>

### Specification repository

<GithubInfo className="not-prose" owner="vrchatapi" repo="specification" />

The main [specification repository](https://github.com/vrchatapi/specification) contains the OpenAPI specification that defines the VRChat API. This is where most contributions happen, from documenting newly discovered endpoints to refining response schemas that don't quite match the actual API responses.

Common contributions include adding missing endpoints, updating response models when fields are incorrect or missing, improving parameter descriptions, and adding practical examples.f

The related [specification-test repository](https://github.com/vrchatapi/specification-test) contains automated tests that run against VRChat's live API to validate the accuracy and completeness of the OpenAPI specification.

<GithubInfo className="not-prose" owner="vrchatapi" repo="specification-test" />

### Language-specific SDK repositories
Each programming language has its own repository with generated SDKs based on the OpenAPI specification. These are automatically generated from the OpenAPI specification and provide type-safe API clients for different programming languages.

))}
</div>

### Documentation site
This documentation site has its own repository for guides, tutorials, and website improvements.
