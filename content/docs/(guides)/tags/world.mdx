Worlds can also have a range of different event-specific tags such as `admin_vket2021` for the Vket row, `admin_muzzfesst` for the MUZZFEST event, or `admin_halloween_2019` for the 2019 Halloween row. These are not listed because it would be impossible to accurately keep such list up-to-date, and each tag is of little use outside of that specific event.
